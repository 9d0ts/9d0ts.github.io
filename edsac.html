  	<h1>EDSAC &amp; OXO</h1>
    <p><span class="highlight">OXO</span> was an early video game created 
    by Alexander Douglas when he was a Ph.D. student at Cambridge University 
    in England. OXO was played on an <span class="highlight">EDSAC</span> computer. 
    Players could choose 
    to move first or allow the computer to do so. They entered their 
    moves by using a rotary telephone and saw the game on a small CRT 
    (cathode ray tube). OXO was not played 
    very much outside Cambridge.</p>

    The <span class="highlight">EDSAC computer</span> ran its first programs in 1949. 
    It was the first computer that could store its own programs in its memory instead 
    of using pluggable wires. In the picture below, you can see the rotary phone 
    and screens that players used for OXO.
