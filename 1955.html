  	<h1>Bill Gates</h1>
    <p>William Henry Gates (b. 1955) began programming at age 13. In high school, 
    he wrote software for his school that included its payroll and scheduling systems. 
    He says that he used this opportunity to schedule himself into classes with girls he liked!</p>
    <p>At Harvard College, he developed software for the first small computers, 
    called <strong>microcomputers.</strong> 
    In 1975, he left Harvard and founded Microsoft with the help of
    his childhood friend, Paul Allen. Gates was a brilliant business
    strategist as well as computer scientist. He focused on deals with the biggest
    company at that time &mdash; IBM. Eventually IBM became dependent
    on Microsoft for all its microcomputer software, and Microsoft
    became the world's dominant 
    computer company instead of IBM. </p>
    <p>Gates now spends much of his time running The Bill &amp; 
    Melinda Gates Foundation, which has improved health care for millions of 
    people around the world.</p>
