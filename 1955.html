  	<h1>Bill Gates</h1>
    <p>William Henry Gates (b. 1955) began programming at age 13. In high school, 
    he wrote software for his school that included its payroll and scheduling systems. 
    He says that he scheduled himself into classes with girls he liked!</p>
    <p>At Harvard College, he developed software for the first small computers, 
    called <strong>microcomputers.</strong> 
    In 1975, he left Harvard and founded Microsoft with the help of
    his childhood friend, Paul Allen. Gates was a brilliant business
    strategist as well as computer scientist. He made deals with the company that
    dominated the computer industry at the time, IBM. Eventually IBM became dependent
    on Microsoft for all its microcomputer software, and the business world turned
    upside down. Microsoft became the world's dominant computer company, and Windows
    became the dominant computer operating system.</p>
    <p>Gates now spends his time advising Microsoft and running The Bill &amp; 
    Melinda Gates Foundation, which has improved health care for millions of 
    people around the world.</p>
