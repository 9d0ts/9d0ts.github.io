      The pictures below tell a story about important events in computer history.
      The story, however, is hidden. To find the story, you must have the soul of a hacker. 
      Here are some clues.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Use your Google search skills to find the name of the computer or person in each 
          picture. Scan the search results to gather a little information about the picture.
        </li>
        <li>
          There's a hidden page on this website about the picture. Use the information you gathered to guess the page name. 
          Type your guess into the address box. 
          If you're right, you'll find one chapter of the story. <em>Tip!</em> Don't use capital letters in page names.
