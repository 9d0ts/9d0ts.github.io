      The pictures below tell a story about important events in computer history.
      However, the story is hidden. To find the story, you must have the soul of a hacker. 
      Here are some clues.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use your Google search skills to find the name of the computer or person in each 
          picture. Scan the search results to gather a little
          additional information as well. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Then use the information you gathered to guess the name of a hidden page on this website. 
          Type the page name you guessed into the address box. 
          If you're right, you'll find one chapter of the story. <em>Hint!</em> Don't use capital letters in page names.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you find the page, complete the printed <strong>Computer History</strong> worksheet.
        </li>
      </ul>
