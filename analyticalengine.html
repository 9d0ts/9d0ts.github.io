  	<h1>Charles Babbage &amp; The Analytical Engine</h1>
    <p>English mathematician Charles Babbage (1791-1871) is often called the "Father of Computing."
    He invented several important mechanical devices called <span class="highlight">difference engines</span>
    and <span class="highlight">analytical engines.</span> 
    <span class="highlight">Difference engines</span> were
    efficient calculators. <span class="highlight">Analytical engines</span> moved
    beyond simple calculation to more general tasks, much like 
    modern computers. Here's a picture of an analytical engine.

    <p>The analytical engine is  
    the first <em>general purpose, programmable computing engine.</em> 
   	Although Babbage died before he could finish building
    it, he left detailed plans. 
    It was programmable using punched cards. (The idea of using punched cards
    came from the Jacquard loom, which was used 
    during the 19th century for weaving complex patterns in textiles.) 
    The analytical engine was also capable of using complex logic like "if ... then" and
    "repeat" statements. It could produce many kinds of output including printed pages,
    punched cards, and graph plotting.</p>
