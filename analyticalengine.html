  	<h1>Charles Babbage &amp; The Analytical Engine</h1>
    <p>English mathematician Charles Babbage (1791-1871) is often called the "Father of Computing."
    He invented several important mechanical devices called <span class="highlight">difference engines</span>
    and <span class="highlight">analytical engines.</span> 
    <span class="highlight">Difference engines</span> were
    efficient calculators. <span class="highlight">Analytical engines</span> 
    were much more sophisticated. First described in 1837, they moved beyond simple 
    calculation to more general tasks much like 
    modern computers. For example, they could repeat commands and figure out "if-then" logic.
    Unfortunately, Babbage died before he could finish building
    his analytical engine.
