  	<h1>Colossus</h1>
    <p><span class="highlight">Colossus</span> was the name of a series of 
    computers invented by British codebreakers between 1943-1945. These 
    computers helped to win World War II by translating ("cracking") 
    secret coded messages sent between 
    German military leaders and their troops. </p>

    <p>Colossus computers were the first electronic programmable computers. 
    "Electronic" means all their parts involved electrical circuits
    than mechanical gears and levers. "Programmable" meant that the computer 
    could behave in different ways based on the program they loaded. (Earlier computers
    could only behave in one way!) </p>
    <p>Colossus computers were different from our modern 
    computers, though. Although they could behave in different ways,
    they could only 
    do one kind of task &mdash; codebreaking. Also, they had no screens and no 
    keyboards where you could type or create a program for them to run.  
    Instead, people programmed them by moving wires among different switches on the 
    outside of the computer. (The term 
    "hardwired" is related to this idea.) 
    Colossus computers printed their results on an electric typewriter.</p>
