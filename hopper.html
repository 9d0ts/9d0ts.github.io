  	<h1>The First Computer Bug</h1>
    <p><img src="images/gracehopper.jpg">Grace Hopper (1906 &ndash; 1992) was a computer scientist and also a Rear Admiral
    in the United States Navy. She was one of the first computer programmers, and 
    she pioneered the development of programming languages that could work across  
    many different computers. (Until then, each computer had its own language.)</p>
    <p>On September 9, 1945, at 3:45 p.m., Grace Hopper recorded an event that 
    made her famous. While investigating a problem in her computer program, 
    she found a surprising cause: a moth was stuck among the components of her Harvard
    Mark II computer. In her scientist's logbook, she humorously recorded that &mdash; unlike more 
    elusive computer bugs &mdash; this was the "first actual case of bug being found."
