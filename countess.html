  	<h1>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace</h1>
    <p>Augusta Ada King (1815-1852), known more familiarly as Ada Lovelace, 
    was the daughter
    of the famous British poet, Lord George Gordon Byron.</p>

    <p>Ada met Charles Babbage
    in 1832, when she was 17 years old. He encouraged her to study mathematics. 
    Eventually, she translated an article about Babbage's analytical engine from 
    French to English, and in the process she became fascinated by the machine. She added 
    her own notes to the translation, and they became 3 times longer than the article itself. The notes described
    how to create codes to represent symbols and letters as well as numbers. 
    They also described how the engine could repeat a list of instructions, 
    a process called "looping" that modern computers still use. For these
    reasons, Lovelace is often called <span class="highlight">the first computer programmer.</span></p>
