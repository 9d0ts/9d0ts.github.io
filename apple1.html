  	<h1>Steve Jobs (1955 &ndash; 2011) &amp; Steve Wozniak</h1>
    <p>
    Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer in 1976. Their
    first computer, the Apple I (in the the box), was sold to computer hobbyists who like to
    build their own computers. At the time, that was the only way you could have
    a personal computer! There weren't any commercial personal computers for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Apple I was successful and launched the company. But Jobs' concern with 
    design and ease of use guided the development of the next computer, called Apple II.
    This computer didn't require assembly. You can see the Apple IIc in the white box above.

    <p>
    Against prevailing trends, Apple insisted on making computers that were easy to 
    use but also relatively expensive. Apple had many up's and down's. Steve Wozniak
    left the company in 1981, and Steve jobs was forced to leave his company by 
    its Board of Directors in 1985.

    But Jobs was not done yet. He headed 2 new companies &mdash; Pixar and NeXT Computer.
    Pixar pioneered computer programming to create animation. NeXT was less successful, the
    but software it developed became unexpectedly important in 1997, when Apple
    asked Jobs to return to the ailing company. Rescuing Apple from imminent
    bankruptcy, Jobs used NeXT software to launch a new and successful line of Macintosh
    computers.

    The biggest successes were yet to come. In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod.
    Its simplicity and beauty inspired people to buy both iPods and Macintosh computers. 
    Then in 2007, Apple unveiled the wildly
    successful iPhone &mdash; an iPod that you could use for making calls. 
    With the introduction of the iPad in 2010, Apple's design dominance was complete.
