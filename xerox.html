  	<h1>Xerox Alto</h1>
    <p>
    To use early computers, users had to type commands. Here's a picture of one
    early computer screen:</p>

    <p>But in 1973, Xerox Corporation pioneered
    a radically new computer called Alto. This computer had the first <strong>mouse and graphical
    user interface (GUI)</strong>, allowing users to move a pointer and click the screen to
    indicate what they wanted to do instead of typing commands. You can see the Alto below.</p>
    <p>
    Alto eventually revolutionized personal computing, but not because of Xerox.
    In fact, Xerox eventually stopped the Alto project. But just before they did, 
    a young entrepreneur named Steve Jobs heard about
    Alto and visited Xerox. He was stunned by what he saw and recognized its potential immediately.
    He went back to his own company, Apple, and quietly developed the Macintosh, which 
    became first popular personal computer with a GUI and a mouse. Apple 
    changed the face of computing forever.

    In the picture of Alto below, the mouse, keyboard, and screen are on the desk, and the system 
    unit (the main computer box) is below the desk.
