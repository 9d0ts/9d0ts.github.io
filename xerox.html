  	<h1>Xerox Alto</h1>
    <p>
    One of the most interesting stories in computer history concerns a company 
    that doesn't make computers anymore. In 1973, Xerox Corporation pioneered
    a radically new computer called Alto. This computer had the first mouse and <strong>graphical
    user interface (GUI)</strong>, allowing users to move a pointer and click the screen to
    indicate what they wanted to do instead of typing commands. </p>
    <p>
    The Alto eventually revolutionized personal computing, but Xerox never made a
    penny from it. Instead, in 1979 a young entrepreneur named Steve Jobs heard about
    Alto and visited Xerox. He was stunned by what he saw and recognized its potential.
    He went back to his own company, Apple, and developed the Macintosh, which 
    became first popular personal computer with a GUI and a mouse. Years before
    Microsoft, Apple launched the future of personal computing.

    unit (the main computer box) is below the desk.
